==== Building 

- ../autogen.sh
- ./configure
- make
- sudo make install

==== Linux

Should "just work" if you have the following packages installed:

- libusb-1.0-dev
- freeglut3-dev (or whatever freeglut dev package your distro has)

Since there's no udev rules yet, you'll need to run glview as
root. Deal with it.

==== OS X

NOTE: AS OF 2010-11-16, WE HAVE UPDATED THIS PATCH. IF YOU HAVE
ALREADY PATCHED, PLEASE REPATCH AND REINSTALL LIBUSB TO GET OS X
WORKING AT FULL 30FPS.

You will need to pull the libusb-1.0 repo head and patch using the
files in platform/osx/. Just go to the root directory of the cloned
libusb-1.0 repo and run

patch -p1 < [path_to_OpenKinectRepo]/platform/osx/libusb-osx-kinect.diff
